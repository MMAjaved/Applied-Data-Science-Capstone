# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This Capstone is the 10th course in the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) specialization. It summarizes all the materials learned during this specialization in the form of a project.
## Project Background
SpaceX is the most successful company of the commercial space age, making space travel affordable. The company advertises its Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website, with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers charge over 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings come from SpaceX's ability to reuse the first stage. Therefore, by determining if the first stage will land, we can assess the cost of a launch. We will predict whether SpaceX will reuse the first stage based on public information and machine learning models.
